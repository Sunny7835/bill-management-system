Bill Management System
A simple and easy-to-use Bill Management System that allows users (admins) to manage bills and perform basic billing operations. This system includes features like user registration, login functionality, and an admin panel for managing bills and users.

User Login: Users can log in with their registered username and password.
Bill Management: Admins can manage bills, generate new bills, and maintain a record of all transactions.
SQLite Database: The system uses an SQLite database to store user and bill data.
Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language for building the application.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
SQLite: For managing and storing user and bill data in a relational database.
Pillow (PIL): For image processing (e.g., displaying images like logos, backgrounds).
